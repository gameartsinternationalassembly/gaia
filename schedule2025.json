At the crossroads of video games, live performances and critical reflection, the term Playformance has been coined by the French collective Sous les néons to describe a form of performative art, on stage, using the act of playing to create meaning and to explore the narratives, ideologies and systems embedded in digital games. It is a situated performance that uses the game’s mechanics, its worlds, and its relationship to the player as expressive materials. questions “what does it mean to play with intentions?” To be affected, to resist, to perform — together?
